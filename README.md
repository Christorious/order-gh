 An open-source delivery coordination engine for Ghana and beyond.
# Order.GH 🚚🇬🇭 – An Open Source Delivery Coordination Engine for Africa

Order.GH is an open-source delivery platform built for the realities of Ghana and the wider African continent. It helps users coordinate the delivery of goods, legal documents, medical supplies, and farm produce through a decentralized, privacy-focused app.

We aim to turn *delivery chaos* into *organized opportunity* — starting at the grassroots level.

## 🔍 Problem We're Solving

Delivery in Ghana is frustrating.

- You waste hours in traffic to pick up one document.
- Smallholder farmers lose income because they can’t get produce to buyers in time.
- Riders struggle to get consistent income.
- No protection for users against fraud or abuse during delivery exchanges.

Order.GH exists to **connect people to people** — safely, efficiently, and locally.

## 💡 Core Features

- 🛵 **Request-Based Delivery**: Create a delivery request for a product, document, or produce. Nearby riders can accept it.
- ⏳ **Standard or Express Options**: Wait for a standard time or pay extra for faster delivery.
- 📜 **Legal Document Logistics**: Deliver case files, forms, and notarized docs without the sender and rider ever meeting in person.
- 🥬 **Farm-to-Home Fresh Produce**: Coordinate neighborhood food drops with farmers and local riders.
- 🔐 **Blockchain Privacy Layer**: Your identity and location are protected using decentralized identity protocols.
- ⚖️ **Smart Escrow & Verification**: Payments are released only after delivery confirmation via smart contracts.
- 📱 **Built for Mobile First**: Lightweight design, built with low-bandwidth and GPS-inconsistent regions in mind.
- ⚙️ **Drone & IoT Ready (Future)**: Modular APIs that allow drone pickups and robotic delivery.

## 🧱 How It Works

1. A sender creates a delivery request in the app.
2. A rider with a matching route accepts the order.
3. Both parties communicate anonymously through the app.
4. Delivery is tracked and confirmed with secure codes/photos.
5. Payments are managed via smart contracts and released after confirmation.

## 🔐 Why Blockchain?

- **Anonymity**: Riders and requesters don't need to know each other's real name or contact.
- **Security**: Prevents misuse of the system for crimes like fraud or kidnapping.
- **Trustless Payments**: Smart contracts hold the delivery fee until confirmation.
- **Immutable Ratings**: Every user builds a verifiable reputation.

We’re exploring networks like **Polygon**, **IPFS**, and **VerusID** for secure, low-cost implementation.

## 🚀 Our Vision

We’re building **an engine**, not just an app.

This engine should be usable by:
- Motorbike riders
- Farmers’ cooperatives
- Legal firms and court offices
- Clinics and health centers
- Drone fleets and maker communities

> One day, it should power everything from town-level delivery to intercontinental logistics across Africa.

## 🧠 Project Status

> 🚧 In Active Brainstorming + MVP Planning Phase

We are currently:
- Building a simple prototype
- Mapping the blockchain interaction model
- Gathering contributors for mobile frontend + backend APIs
- Outlining potential pilot projects (legal offices, clinics, farms)

## 🛠 Example Use Case

> Kofi, a rider heading from Accra to Madina, sees a request to deliver a legal affidavit from Mataheko to Ridge Court. He accepts it. The sender's identity is hidden. Kofi gets a secure code. Once the doc is delivered, the system confirms it. Kofi gets paid instantly. No calls. No stress. No long waits.

## ❤️ Built For the People, With the People

This project started as a simple question after a 3-hour ride to collect a document:

> "What if riders, farms, and everyday people could connect — safely and anonymously — to move products across Ghana?"

If that vision resonates with you, join us.
