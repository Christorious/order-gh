# Drone Delivery Module (Future Support)

This module prepares Order.GH to support autonomous drone deliveries â€” for items like legal documents, medical supplies, or fresh produce.

**This is experimental and designed for future integration.**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Enable integration of autonomous drones as delivery agents.
- Use blockchain to preserve user privacy and verify delivery securely.
- Allow open vendors to plug in drone fleets into the Order.GH system.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Current State

We simulate drone delivery using scripts. Real drone integration will use open standards like:

- [PX4 Autopilot](https://px4.io/)
- [MAVLink](https://mavlink.io/en/)
- 4G/LTE Modules
- Onboard microcontrollers (e.g., Raspberry Pi + Pixhawk)

---

## ðŸ§  Concept

- Drones register as agents (like human riders)
- Delivery jobs are sent to drone base stations via secure API
- Drones accept â†’ pick up â†’ deliver â†’ return
- Encrypted drop-off coordinates are used
- Blockchain verifies sender/destination but hides personal info

## ðŸ”§ Folders

- `simulate-delivery.py`: Simulated drone API for testing delivery updates
- `drone-api.md`: Draft of the drone base station API
- `hardware-list.md`: Suggested parts list for building or integrating drones
